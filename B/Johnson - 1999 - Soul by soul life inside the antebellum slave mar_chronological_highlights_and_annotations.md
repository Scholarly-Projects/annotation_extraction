## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 9**: indeed it could be said that the daily process by which two million people were bought and sold over the course of the antebellum period has been hidden from historical view by the very aggregations that have been used to represent it

## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 9**: follow in from a tradition of work in African america history stretching back at least to we e be do boss Black reconstruction this book began with the idea that the history of any struggle no matter how  its initial appearance is incomplete until told from the perspectives of all of those whose agency shaped the outcome

## General Notes
- **Page 10**: In proslavery responses to the narratives which were taken up by early historians of slavery like rich be  the narratives were treated as politically interested fabrications and were dismissed according to one of the most durable paradoxes of white  idea that those who are closest to an experience of oppression in this case former slaves are its least credible witnesses

## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 10**: Rather than charting a map of foreordained conclusions I have tried to understand a slave sale from the contingent perspective of each of its participants assess their asymmetric information expectations and power to search out their mutual misunderstandings and calculated misrepresentations to investigate what each had at stake and how each tried to shape the outcome

## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 10**: These pioneering efforts have been bolstered by the careful scholarship of John  josh  Sue taking and others who have authenticated some of the more controversial narratives piece by piece Locating telling details and matching them to other sources they have retrieved the narratives from the  skepticism that dismissed them as fabrication

## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 12**: The descriptions of events in the narratives often include telling details which could not be fully contained by the purposes of antislavery editors and amanuenses Visual descriptions of other slaves for example can be read as evidence of the way strangers evaluated one another in the coffees and slave pens likewise the biographies of other slaves often presented as a scene setting aside to the narrators central struggle can be read as evidence of a history of communal life and collective resistance among slaves in the trade which was largely excised from the narrators printed act counts

## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 12**: Some incidents appear so often that it seems certain they are stock figures drawn from the reading of other narratives rather than from experience

## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 13**: I have relied heavily on the docket records of approximately two hundred cases of disputed slave sales that came before the  Supreme Court in the nineteenth century

- **Page 15**: Historians have generally followed the traders in dealing the boundaries of the slave trade around the commercial record it pro ducked sale in the upper South to a slave trader as a beginning and a sale to a slaveholder in the lower South as an end

## Author Thesis and Methodology
- **Page 16**: As they went to the slave market for example potential buyers might have been  playing a part in the historical project of making manifest the expansionary destiny of the antebellum regime or they might have made their  choices with an eye toward crop calendars and cycles of commercial specula tiny or they might have simply imagined their presence in the market as part of their own  stages of a shareholding life cycle marked out in purchased slaves
