# Highlights and Annotations from Johnson - 1999 - Soul by soul life inside the antebellum slave mar

This document contains the extracted highlights and annotations.

## Blue Highlights
- **Page 3**: Both of these markets were
really clusters of competing ~rms, each of which, in turn, maintained
its own yard for keeping slaves—“slave pens” in the parlance of the
trade—and frontage for displaying  them.
- **Page 3**: they
began in the neighborhood where today Chartres Street meets broad,
boulevarded Esplanade—a few short blocks from the levee, past the
cathedral and the gin houses and sailor’s tenements that served the
nearby docks
- **Page 3**: the smells of ~fty or a hundred people
forced to live in a space the size of a home lot.
- **Page 4**: The real business took place in the show-
rooms, which were large enough for a hundred slaves to be arrayed
around their walls, questioned, and examined.
- **Page 4**: By the end of the ~fteenth century, Portuguese merchants and
soldiers had dotted four thousand miles of the west coast of Africa with
outposts, where they traded for slaves to export to sugar- and wine-pro-
ducing islands off the coas
- **Page 4**: The Portuguese were shortly followed to
Africa by the other imperial powers of Europe: the Spanish in the
sixteenth century, the Dutch, Danes, French, and English in the seven-
teenth. Beginning in the 1650s, when sugar planted on Barbados and in
Brazil began to grow into huge pro~ts for colonial planters and metro-
politan shippers, the African trade was a central concern of Europe’s
colonial powers, each of which attempted to control it through exclu-
sive licensing and colonial customs.
- **Page 5**: tobacco, indigo, rice, cotton, coffee, and
especially sugar.
- **Page 5**: Indeed, up to the year 1820, ~ve times as many Africans traveled
across the Atlantic as did Europeans.
- **Page 5**: Closing the trade was favorable to both opponents of slavery and a
portion of slaveholders, mostly Virginians, who feared that the contin-
- **Page 6**: ued importation of slaves would dilute the social power that their own
slaves supported.
- **Page 6**: But in these years the
trade was a practice without a name or a center, a series of speculations
made along the roads linking the small towns of the rural South into an
attenuated political economy of slavery.
- **Page 6**: y, the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, the
purchase of Louisiana in 1803, and the subjugation of southern Indians,
~nalized along the T
rail of T
ears in 1838, opened new regions of the
South to cultivation and slavery.
- **Page 7**: Some of them were insured in transit, some
few others covered by life insurance. Their sales had to be notarized
and their sellers taxed. Those hundreds of thousands of people were
revenue to the cities and states where they were sold, and pro~ts in the
pockets of landlords,  provisioners, physicians, and insurance agents
long before they were sold.
- **Page 8**: Contrary to the popular image, most of these slaves were not
sold quickly at large public auctions but in extended private bargains
made in the slave pens maintained by slave dealers
- **Page 8**: Those whose slave-based
agricultural ventures proved successful made their way back to the pens,
this time looking for skilled artisans and domestic slaves who repre-
sented the high end of the slave market and could be found only in large
urban centers like New Orleans
- **Page 9**: Thus the history of the slave trade
has often been represented graphically as an outline of prices and the
volume of trade—rising into spiky peaks through the 1830s and then
plunging into sharp decline, only to rise again in the 1850s
- **Page 10**: In
proslavery responses to the narratives, which were taken up by early
historians of slavery like Ulrich B. Phillips, the narratives were treated
as politically interested fabrications and were dismissed according to
one of the most durable paradoxes of white supremacy—the idea that
those who are closest to an experience of oppression (in this case,
former slaves) are its least credible witnesses.
- **Page 18**: into
the terrible density of the interchange between masters and slaves,
whose bodies and souls were daily fused into common futures in the
slave market.
- **Page 21**: In practice
by running away or otherwise resisting their sale, forcing their owners
to create public knowledge of the violent underpinnings of their power.
- **Page 22**: the bodies of slave children were forcibly
shaped to their slavery.
- **Page 23**: enslaved children were taught to experi-
ence their bodies twice at once, to move through the world as both child
and slave, person and property.
- **Page 23**: The threat of sale, Johnson later remembered,
infused his friendships with fear.
- **Page 23**: Under the chattel prin-
ciple, every advance into enslaved society—every reliance on another,
every child, friend, or lover, every social relation—held within it the
threat of its own dissolution.
- **Page 24**: For slaves, especially those in the exporting states of
the upper South, time and space were bent around the ever-present
threat of sale to a slave trader.
- **Page 25**: The state of Louisi-
ana outlawed the trade entirely during the period of panic that followed
Nat T
urner’s 1831 rebellion
- **Page 25**: Far from being ever-present in cities like New Orleans, the slave
market was a  quarantined space, legally bounded by high walls to
“prevent them from being seen from the street
- **Page 25**: In his description, slave traders looked almost
as different from other southern whites as slaves did.
- **Page 26**: Scapegoating the trad-
ers was a good way to defend the rest of slavery.
- **Page 26**: The entire economy of the antebellum South was
constructed upon the idea that the bodies of enslaved people had a
measurable monetary value, whether they were ever actually sold or
not.
- **Page 27**: The value
attached to unsold slaves was much more useful to antebellum business-
men than that attached to land, for slaves were portable and the slave
traders promised ready cash
- **Page 27**: Slaveholders like Welhan could track their fortunes in
Af_eck’s Planter’s Annual Record, which provided a convenient table by
which slaves’ annual increase in value could be tracked in the same set
of tables as their daily cotton production, and a page at the back where
the “planter” could ~ll in the value of his slave force, and calculate the
“interest   on the same at ten percent.”
- **Page 28**: It is rather to
say that “ordinary” slaveholders generally supplied public reckonings of
what they did, reasoned explanations—accidents, opportunities, practi-
calities, necessities—that made clear why at one moment they decided
to sell a slave whom they would otherwise have wanted to keep
- **Page 28**: And they traced an imaginary line of
self-justi~cation between “slavery,”  where slaves were sold only by
happenstance, and the “market,” where every slave was always for sale.
- **Page 30**: Were slave sales, as so many
slaveholders insisted, the unfortunate results of untimely deaths, un-
avoidable debts, unforeseeable circumstances, and understandable pun-
ishments, or were they, as so many slaves felt, the natural, inevitable,
and predictable result of a system that treated people as property?
- **Page 31**: Indeed, many slave sales had to be negotiated twice through—once
with the buyer and once with the merchandise
- **Page 32**: Facing both social death and
literal death in the killing ~elds of the lower South,
- **Page 33**: White also points out that men were more likely
to face solitary sale than women. Particularly in the years before 1850,
when men were being exported from the upper South in far greater
numbers than women, it was men who were most likely to ~nd them-
y
selves in a situation where they had nothing to lose by running away.28
- **Page 34**: What is clear is that he had plenty of help from neighboring slaves in
escaping, hiding, and deciding when to come out. With the help of the
very community from which he was to be separated by the trade, Hicks
stayed away until he was satis~ed with the terms of his own sale.
- **Page 34**: The agent ~rst
estimated the situation as a negotiation gone bad—upon learning the
terms, the slaves demurred and declined—but his conclusion made it
sound more like an open war.
- **Page 35**: “Ednoull tells me,” he wrote, “that you and Mary Ann
said when he and Sally married that they should never be parted and
says that if I send him from her it will not do you or anybody else any
good—meaning I suppose that he will kill himself.
- **Page 35**: He would take his own
life—and, he made explicit, destroy the value he embodied—if he were
separated from his wife.
- **Page 36**: By reminding Copes that the slave-
holder had promised to respect his marriage, by recounting his history
with Copes in the grammar of promise and obligation, Ednoull had
changed the ~eld of meanings that his removal had for his master. What
had been for his master a detail of business was reframed by Ednoull as
matter of the man’s honor.
- **Page 37**: It should
go without saying that slaves’ invocations of their owners’ paternalist
promises were often strategic: they implied no internalization of slave-
p
holder paternalism.3
- **Page 38**: Slaveholders, much of the literature on the antebellum South reminds
us, were decorous people: they did not like scenes, at least not those
choreographed by someone else
- **Page 39**: The few slaves who resisted sale shaped the market
practice of many masters, forcing slaveholders to create public knowl-
edge of their complicity with the traders by trying to anticipate their
slaves’ resistance.
- **Page 39**: “and you must do what you can to reconcile
them, tell them (which is the fact) that I owed Mr. Lyon and had no
other way of paying.
- **Page 41**: Their pre-emptive explanations, lies, and violence betray
their awareness of the feelings of the people they sold. The threat of
resistance thus forced a rupture in the tidy transcript of commercial
necessity and moralizing self-justi~cation by creating public knowledge
of “ordinary” slaveholders’ complicity in the world the slave traders
made
- **Page 43**: He carefully marked a line between his own experience
and the experiences of others which, through tellings and retellings that
carried them ever further from their origins, had been transformed into
an indigenous antislavery ideology.
- **Page 44**: Through singing these songs, slaves translated the
tragically isolating personal experience of the trade into a shared anti-
slavery ideology.
- **Page 45**: I’ll send you my love by the whoop-o’-will;
The dove shall bring my sorrow;
I leave you a drop of my heart’s own blood,
For I won’t be back tomorrow.
- **Page 45**: in
every bird a message
- **Page 47**: they were
speculators
- **Page 47**: T
o minimize the amount of information
they had to gather, and to maximize their pro~ts, they packed their
- **Page 48**: slaves into categories of comparison and distributed them according to
demand: they treated people like things.
- **Page 48**: Their pro~ts depended
on isolating the ill and containing the unruly,
- **Page 48**: on keeping their slaves
from forming dangerous alliances or threatening attachments in the
cof_es or pens—on recognizing and regulating the humanity of the
people they bought and sold.
- **Page 48**: But for many slaves, the
connections they made in the cof_es and pens allowed them to establish
networks of support that could sustain them through the trade
- **Page 49**: Many of the smaller ~rms created a small-
town version of the interstate trade between urban centers.
- **Page 52**: Many of the slaves in these men’s yards were being
sold by the traders on behalf of people who would not have considered
themselves professional slave traders.
- **Page 52**: none of these sales were recorded as if a slave trader was involved, and
thus they have been passed over by those who have tried to tabulate the
traders’ share of the broader market in slaves by counting out the
numbers of traders’ names on registered Acts of Sale.
- **Page 53**: Bowles’s  testimony outlines a pyramidal
network of information gathering and slave selling that stretched from
the slave pens through the city’s hotels and barrooms—a network in
which every bartender was a potential broker and every broker tried to
control every bartender. The lively traf~c in information and in_uence
that joined the slave traders to the hotels and bars where travelers and
traders gathered and discussed their business suggests that the practice
of trading slaves far outreached the cluster of pens publicly identi~ed as
“the slave market.”
- **Page 55**: Most of the prices in the two books
match, but when the books do not match, the difference—ranging
from twenty-~ve to three hundred dollars per sale—is almost always in
the favor of the book kept by John White. White, it seems, was cook-
ing the books he showed to his partner and skimming an extra share of
g
p
the sales he made in Louisiana.20
- **Page 56**: In closing, Jarratt
underlined his incongruous paternalism with the phrase “Howdy to the
Negroes.”
- **Page 58**: As a witness heard it, he told Coot, “I will give you a thousand dollars,
and do you come and spend your days with me, and when I die you shall
have what I have got.
- **Page 58**: There were
various commercial arrangements designed to narrow the speculative
distance between the ~rst sale and the second. The most common was
brokerage—matching a buyer to a seller without assuming a direct risk
by buying the slave.
- **Page 59**: By claiming to represent a totality of
human attributes without referring directly to any of them, the traders’
tables ~xed people in a system of comparison which was located solely in
the slave market. The traders used these made-up market categories to
compare physically different people to one another.
- **Page 60**: T
o get their point across the traders used
names that summoned up individual slaves whom they had both known
and conversed with as well as sold: they referred to a human history
hidden behind the numbers they recorded in their account books. Good
business required the traders to recognize the individuality of the peo-
ple they hoped to turn into prices.
- **Page 60**: t he would
try to ~nd them “as good places” as he could if they would “go without
y
g
p
y
g
any trouble.”35 This was slave-trader paternalism, a disciplinary specu-
lation on the feelings of the people they bought.
- **Page 61**: The cof_e Martin described was a series of identities arranged along the
chain for easy supervision: those who seemed resistant followed by those
who did not; those who had no attachments followed by those who were
judged unlikely to leave family members or dependents behind to run
away. The cof_es were a reverse image of the commodity categories by
which the traders selected their slaves—speculations on the very human
attachments it was the traders’ business to destroy.
- **Page 62**: Distance reduced the risks for those who traveled south with the
slaves. The farther slaves went in the trade, the more dif~cult it became
for them to return to their homes or escape to freedom.
- **Page 63**: A number of different
traders had their slaves aboard the ship, and segregating them by sex
was a way to keep one slaveholder’s slaves from diminishing the value
of another’s by passing a disease—or starting a pregnancy.
- **Page 64**: T
o protect themselves and
their investment, the traders had to imagine the world from their slaves’
perspective: to see geography and time and human connections and
desire as their slaves did and to insinuate their surveillance and insert
their discipline in every detail of the slaves’ existence.
- **Page 65**: T
o the social death experienced by those torn from
their histories and identities and the physical death they faced in the
killing ~elds of the lower South must be added the psychic deaths—the
“soul murder”—that left many of the trade’s victims with little will to
resist.48
- **Page 68**: p
g
6 But whatever the origin of the
speci~c descriptions, their general intent is clear: in the outward ap-
pearance of the slaves he met in the trade, Northup was seeking infor-
mation about their inward relation to the system he was trying to
escape.
- **Page 69**: Former slave Peter Bruner remembered that the slave traders whipped
the slaves to make them sing as they left, and Sella Martin explained
that the songs were meant to “prevent among the crowd of Negroes
who usually gather on such occasions, any expression of sorrow for
- **Page 70**: those who are being torn away from them.” But, Martin continued, “the
Negroes, who have very little hope of seeing those again who are dearer
to them than life, and who are weeping and wailing over the separation,
often turn the song thus demanded into a farewell dirge.
- **Page 70**: One of their favorite
songs was ‘James Crack Corn I don’t Care.’ Their object was said to set
their master at de~ance, and to show their willingness to leave him . .
- **Page 72**: More than anything, the community of slaves in the trade seems to
have been forged out of conversation.
- **Page 74**: The
man’s response was concrete enough: “I have heard there is a place
called Philadelphia,” he said, “where black people are all free, but I do
not know which way it lies, nor what road I should take to get there;
and if I knew the way how could I hope to get there?”
- **Page 75**: Ball’s conversations allow us to eavesdrop on an underground net-
work, set up and quickly dismantled, which circulated fragments of
information about freedom and the North among those who could be
trusted.
- **Page 76**: and at that moment Washing-
ton called out for the other slaves to join him. Eighteen rushed up from
the hold and, as the ship’s crew and slave traders ran onto the deck, set
upon their captors with guns and knives.
- **Page 76**: Apparent in the Creole rebellion are the “infrapolitics” of the slave
community in the trade—the generally invisible processes by which a
- **Page 77**: Though it is ultimately
unclear whether the nineteen rebels had tried to keep their plans secret
from the others, tried unsuccessfully to convince them to join, or even,
as the mate suspected, “been appointed by the others as chiefs,” it is clear
that their eventual action emerged, one way or another, out of a negotia-
tion with all of the slaves in the hold.
- **Page 77**: Indeed, the creation of “a slave community” in the
slave trade was less a self-conscious project than an undesigned process
by which a web of interconnection was spun out of a series of everyday
interactions.

## Yellow Highlights
- **Page 3**: Not
far from the levee was North America’s largest slave market.
- **Page 3**: September  and
May—the months that bounded the trading season
- **Page 5**: Royal African
Company and the Dutch West India Company
- **Page 6**: In the seven decades between the Constitution and the
Civil War,
- **Page 7**: It has been estimated
that in slave-exporting regions of the antebellum South the proceeds
from the sale of slaves was equivalent in value to ~fteen percent of the
region’s staple crop economy.
- **Page 8**: Slaves were gathered in Baltimore, Wash-
ington, Richmond, Norfolk, Nashville, and St. Louis and sent south,
either overland in chains, by  sailing ships around the  coast, or by
steamboats down the Mississippi
- **Page 8**: These slaves were sold in the urban
markets of Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, Natchez, and especially New
Orlean
- **Page 21**: In these rituals of
remembrance, the disparate experiences of two million human trage-
dies were built into the ideology of the “chattel principle.”
- **Page 23**: or by
their peculiar combination in the nuzzling violence that characterized
slaveholding “paternalism
- **Page 24**: Among slaveholders, this peculiar mixture of ostensible
moderation and outright threat was called paternalism.
- **Page 44**: an “imagined community” of enslaved people built out of the
ritualization in song
- **Page 46**: John White
- **Page 49**: Like Samuel Browning, who followed the 1848–49 trading season
from Alabama (Bluff Port) to Louisiana (Milliken’s Bend) to Mississippi
(Blackhawk then Greenwood then Yazoo City) and back to Louisiana,
- **Page 50**: The seasonality of the slave trade was tied to the cycles of the larger
agricultural economy. In the upper South, exportation had to wait until
after harvest, because hands were needed in the summer and fall to tend
the crops; in the lower South, buying was delayed until after harvest
because that was when buyers had money available to pay for slaves.
- **Page 51**: The inland journey could take as long as seven or
eight weeks on foot, with the slaves covering about twenty miles a day;
- **Page 52**: Large traders—whether local like Kendig or interstate like John
Hagan of South Carolina—superintended slave yards in New Orleans.
The City T
reasurer’s Census of Merchants listed nineteen such yards in
1854.
- **Page 59**: T
o limit the amount of information they had to send back and forth,
the traders packed people into price categories according to gender, age,

height, weight, and skin color.30 Presiding over these matrices of physi-
cal comparison and price were the type of categories listed on a circular
distributed by the Richmond ~rm Dickinson and Hill in 1860 (and
preserved in the papers of slave trader William Finney): “Extra men,
No. 1 Men; Second Rate or Ordinary Men; Extra Girls, No. 1 Girls,
Second rate or Ordinary Girls.”
- **Page 61**: “A long row of men chained two-and-two together, called the
‘cof_e,’

Charleston in 1799, on the National Road in 1820, in rural Kentucky
in 1829, in Virginia in 1834) or aboard slave ships (on a Mississippi
_atboat in 1826 or at sea on the Decatur in the same year, and aboard
the Lafayette in 1830), slaves who had met one another in the trade
collectively and violently revolted against the trader

in 1841.

## Orange Highlights
- **Page 4**: What follows is the story of these showrooms.
- **Page 5**: There was direct trade among the colonies and be-
tween the colonies and Europe, but much of the Atlantic trade was
triangular: slaves from Africa; sugar from the West Indies and Brazil;
money and manufactures from Europe. People were traded along the
bottom of the triangle; pro~ts would stick at the top
- **Page 7**: Indeed, the price of slaves
tracked the price of cotton to such a degree that it was a commonplace
in the years after 1840 that the price of slaves could be determined by
multiplying the price of cotton by ten thousand (seven cents per pound
for cotton yielding seven hundred dollars per slave)
- **Page 9**: Indeed, it could be said that the daily process by which two
million people were bought and sold over the course of the antebellum
period has been hidden from historical view by the very aggregations
that have been used to represent it
- **Page 9**: Follow-
ing from a tradition of work in African American history stretching
back at least to W. E. B. Du Bois’s Black Reconstruction, this book began
with the idea that the history of any struggle, no matter how one-sided
its initial appearance, is incomplete until told from the perspectives of
all of those whose agency shaped the outcome.
- **Page 10**: Rather than charting a map of foreordained conclusions,
I have tried to understand a slave sale from the contingent perspective
of each of its participants—to assess their asymmetric information,
expectations, and power, to search out their mutual misunderstandings
and calculated misrepresentations, to investigate what each had at stake
and how each tried to shape the outcome.
- **Page 10**: These
pioneering efforts have been bolstered by the careful scholarship of
John Blassingame, Joseph Logsdon, Sue Eakin, and others, who have
authenticated some of the more controversial narratives piece by piece.
Locating telling details and matching them to other sources, they have
retrieved the narratives from the race-tinged skepticism that dismissed
them as fabrication.
- **Page 12**: The descriptions of events
in the narratives often include telling details which could not be fully
contained by the purposes of antislavery editors and amanuenses. Visual
descriptions of other slaves, for example, can be read as evidence of the
way strangers evaluated one another  in the  coffles and  slave pens.
Likewise, the biographies of other slaves, often presented as a scene-
setting aside to the narrator’s central struggle, can be read as evidence
of a history of communal life and collective resistance among slaves in
the trade which was largely excised from the narrators’ printed ac-
counts
- **Page 12**: Some incidents appear so often
that it seems certain they are stock ~gures drawn from the reading of
other narratives rather than from experience.
- **Page 13**: I have relied heavily on the docket
records of approximately two hundred cases of disputed slave sales that
came before the Louisiana Supreme Court in the nineteenth century.
- **Page 14**: g
0 In these strategic appropria-
tions of stock characters and in the con_icting and overlapping formu-
las with which lawyers and litigants framed their cases, I have sought
slaveholders’ commonsense opinion of the limits of what was possible
in the slave pens.3
- **Page 14**: These letters,
then, can be read as remote performances of the self, self-consciously
produced representations that antebellum slaveholders offered to one
another as versions of themselves.
- **Page 15**: Finally, I have relied on the chillingly economical descriptions of slave
sales generated by the trade itself: the notarized Acts of Sale by which a
sale was given legal standing, and the traders’ slave record books, price
g
g
lists, and advertisements.3
- **Page 15**: Historians have generally followed the traders in de~ning the
boundaries of the slave trade around the commercial record it pro-
duced—a sale in the upper South to a slave trader as a beginning and a
sale to a slaveholder in the lower South as an end.
- **Page 15**: The slave trade did not begin or end in the same place
for traders, buyers, and slaves. For slaves, the slave trade was often
much more than a ~nancial exchange bounded in space and time.
- **Page 16**: Instead, it begins with the efforts
of various  historical actors—traders, buyers, or slaves—to imagine,
assimilate, respond to, or resist the slave trade, with the desires and fears
that gave the trade its daily shape. The scope and scale of the chapters
shifts according to the efforts of the participants to understand and
control the history in which they were joined.
- **Page 16**: As they went to the slave market, for example,
potential buyers might have been self-consciously playing a part in the
historical project of making manifest the expansionary destiny of the
antebellum regime, or they might have made their slave-market choices
with an eye toward crop calendars and cycles of commercial specula-
tion, or they might have simply imagined their presence in the market
as part of their own biography—the stages of a slaveholding life cycle
marked out in purchased slaves.
- **Page 18**: The point in emphasizing the
everyday life of the trade is not to diminish the chilling effect of that
broad arrow on the map. It is rather to search out the shape of historical
change in its moment of immediate  expression  and to explore the
contingency of a history that was being pulled apart at the seams even
as it unfolded over time and space.
- **Page 19**: In the slave pens, the yet-un-
made history of antebellum slavery could be daily viewed in the freeze-
framed detail of a single transaction on its leading edge—a trader, a
buyer, and a slave making a bargain that would change the life of eac
- **Page 19**: h.
- **Page 39**: But it
was up to his slaves to be reconciled, to accept that commerce was a
“fact” and their attachments illusory, that paying a debt was a necessity
and preserving their community a luxury.
- **Page 40**: Whether it was the scene itself or the in_uence that open ex-
pressions of loss and betrayal might have on other slaves, their own
family members, or even themselves, some slaveholders sidestepped
the moment of truth with a lie. By so doing they assured themselves
- **Page 41**: a smooth transaction but conceded that their economy could be sus-
tained only at the cost of its pretense of humanity.
- **Page 75**: Ball’s
memoir should not be mistaken for a literal rendering of what hap-
pened in the kitchen. But the structure of the discussion—the initial
connection based on conversation and then the back-and-forth ex-
change of increasingly dangerous information—is something that can
be read from Ball’s subsequent account.
