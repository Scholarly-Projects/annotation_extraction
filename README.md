# Annotation Extraction Tool 
Created by Andrew Weymouth to help code PDF files and extract the text of those annotations to export categorically and chronologically to markdown files so they can be visualized and make connections within Obsidian. To use, add your annotated PDF to the A folder, run the script and categorical and chronological files will generate in the B folder. Adjust color values and names of categories by adjusting data in lines 63-83. Future improvements include adding annotated text, shapes or underlined text. Andrew Weymouth, *Fall 2024*.
